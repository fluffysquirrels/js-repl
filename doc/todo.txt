In progress
 - oo
   - records
     - with-values throws when run on non-record
     - is-a
	 - type-of
     - new takes a values list
	 - new and with-values are macros so values list doesn't need quoting

Unit tests
 - record functions
   - new
   - with-values
   - get-value
 - '
 - macro

Speed up unit tests by banning setg in them and only running init scripts once.

Lisp lib
 - let
 - apply
 - cond
 - data types
   - dict type -- extract from oo
 - pp
 - variadic and, or.

Lang
 - quasiquoting
 - load external files
 - comments
 - strings

Future ideas
 - debugging -- eval once
 - pure functions
 - static typing
 - compile to JS

Code puzzles
 - primality tests.
 - Fibonacci with memoization
 - balanced tree data structures.
