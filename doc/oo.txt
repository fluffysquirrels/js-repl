New functions for records
	record?
	is-a
	typeof
	get-fields
	get-field
	get-values
	new
	with-values:
		e.g. (with-values myrec
				(	(field1 1)
					(field2 "2")
				)
			)
		returns new record with just those values changed

New functions for methods
	.	-- (. my-method my-obj arg1 arg2 arg3)

Redefine func to permit type annotations and check them at run-time.

Ideas
	modules
		functions are defined in modules (like namespaces)
		a class definition is itself a module
		modules have certain access to members of other modules: generalises internal, public, friend, etc.
			defined by some overloaded function (can-call member calling-scope)
		this should be compatible with multi-methods
		still have a single place where "the class itself" is defined: discoverability, can reason about invariants
