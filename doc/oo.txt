New functions for records
	internal - new-record-internal

New functions for methods
	.	-- (. my-method my-obj arg1 arg2 arg3)

Redefine func to permit type annotations and check them at run-time.

Ideas
	modules
		functions are defined in modules (like namespaces)
		a class definition is itself a module
		modules have certain access to members of other modules: generalises internal, public, friend, etc.
			defined by some overloaded function (can-call member calling-scope)
		this should be compatible with multi-methods
		still have a single place where "the class itself" is defined: discoverability, can reason about invariants
