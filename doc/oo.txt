* Records
New functions for records
	add-type
	record=

Add more types
	play types with only primitive fields (e.g. point, vector)
	play types with record fields

Verify field names and types when filling records
Remove types from record field values.

--------
* Funcs
Redefine func to permit type annotations and check them at run-time.
Inheritance with polymorphism. How the fuck?

New functions for methods
	.	-- (. my-method my-obj arg1 arg2 arg3)

---

* Ideas on modules
		functions are defined in modules (like namespaces)
		a class definition is itself a module
		modules have certain access to members of other modules: generalises internal, public, friend, etc.
			defined by some overloaded function (can-call member calling-scope)
		this should be compatible with multi-methods
		still have a single place where "the class itself" is defined: discoverability, can reason about invariants
